Currently looking to build up a front end now for the instagram app I'm making. I've since installed react and got a very basic instagram UI setup. This is not connected to the backend of the website, and instead gets random pictures of dogs, posted by dogs. This is simply a placeholder element which will be replaced with actual data from the online database.

As I'm looking to have the application interactive where by people can view posts and like them, I need some way of recording this data.

As such, I've mapped out the following which I think would be a good way to go forward - always open to suggestions here.

1.  Add more to the backend of the app. The person interacting with the app will need to have their own profile in order to interact properly. As such, the first step should be to create some sort of registation / login feature.

2.  Have the person logging in / creating their app to have their information sent to the database, where their own information is stored etc.

3.  Create a few multiple users and information, and then have this information, including the newly registered persons information/data showing on the app, and have the feed displaying information pulled from the database.

4.  Work on having it interactive. Comments, likes etc.
