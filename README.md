# Restful-API-Express-Coursework

Repository for uploading files that I've worked on through the course I'm doing.

In previous branches there was a fully functioning program with working CRUD operations. While good initially for learning, code was all over the place and files were not doing exactly as they should be.

The code is now being heavily refactored and the evolution of this app can be seen in previous commits.
