# Restful-API-Express-Coursework
Repository for uploading files that I've worked on through the course I'm doing. 

At the moment it is just an introduction to CRUD I've been with.  I got most of it working (I think)
however I seem to be unable to search for people by using their name.  
 
In addition to this, when I'm editting a user, I need to add their name, new photo URL and also the
amount of "likes" they have gotten.  I'm wondering if I should be instead added 3 different PUT
methods, one for each one?
