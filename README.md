# Restful-API-Express-Coursework

Repository for uploading files that I've worked on through the course I'm doing.

In previous branches there was a fully functioning program with working CRUD operations. While good initially for learning, code was all over the place and files were not doing exactly as they should be.

The code has now been heavily refactored and work on the front end has started.

To get started with this app, please run the following script in the terminal

npm run dev
